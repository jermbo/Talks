## What is a Headless CMS anyway

### CMS

Content Management System. A tool to manage the creation and modification of digital content. 

WordPress is the worlds most popular CMS. 

### Headless

Without a "Head" or Front End.

### Headless CMS

"A headless CMS is a back-end only content management system (CMS) built from the ground up as a content repository that makes content accessible via a RESTful API for display on any device." - [source](https://www.storyblok.com/tp/headless-cms-explained)

This opens up the possibility to present your content with any technology you would like. The Headless CMS only responsibilities are to store, secure, and deliver structured content.  

## Let's meet Strapi

Strapi is an open source Headless CMS built in Node.js. 

They boast "The open source Headless CMS Front-End Developers love." - [source](https://strapi.io/)

## Strapi Features 

Strapi offers a bunch of useful features and plugins that offer endless customization.

Out of the box you get:

* Customizable API interface
* Authentication and Permissions
* RESTful APIs
* Plug and Play Databases
* JWT Authentication
* Built-in Emailing

## Thinking outside a blog

I would like to challenge the notion that Headless CMS are only for traditional blogs or brochure websites. I would instead like to think of these as starting places for custom APIs. Not only do you get the benefit of an admin area where you can have non-technical contributors participate. You also have a visual interface to build your you API interface with a matching endpoint, all of the CRUD you would need, and full control over the access. 


## WordPress replacement?

WordPress is the worlds most popular CMS as it powers [35% of the web](https://hostingtribunal.com/blog/wordpress-statistics/). Anything coming for the throne has a very steep hill to climb in order to over throw the king. That doesn't mean there can't be challengers. Strapi is one competitor that I think has a good shot at coming out on top. It's going to take a while and a paradigm shift, but it could happen.

If you need the eco-system that WordPress offers, Strapi might not be a good choice. 

If you are looking for a straight forward CMS with customizable content types and an admin to suit, the I will attempt to convince you that Strapi is a tool worth investing some time in.
