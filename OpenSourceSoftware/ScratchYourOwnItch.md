# Scratch Your Own Itch

Why personal projects are useful tools for your success. Let’s learn how Sample APIs solved a problem I had. How it’s evolved over the years. And why I’m passionate about it. We will take a look under the hood and see how the system is built, what technologies are used, and learn how to contribute to open source.

## Industry moves at a rapid pace

2004 - 2008(ish) I was building static sites in tables. ( Think of Google Sheets, build a site in that!)

2008 - 2011(ish), I was building sites, games, interactive ads using Flash and ActionScript 3.

2010 - 2017, I was building sites with regular ol HTML and CSS. Other sites with WordPress and jQuery.

2012, I started getting more involved with build pipelines. Started learning Gulp to get my Sass to compile.

2013, I started taking JavaScript seriously and learned Node. ( Version 0.8.something! )

2014, I built a more elegant build pipeline. Had Sass auto compile, image compressions, ES6 to ES5 transformations, HTML Preprocessor compilations, automatic browser refresh ( now known as Hot Module Reloading ), and asset migration / minification. 

2015, I started taking programming seriously. I went back to the basics. 

2017 - Present, I am building sites using Vue, Angular, React, and or Svelte.

2020 - I am building sites using Vue or React to statically generate a site. ( Basically vanilla HTML and CSS I was building in 2004, but without the tables)

2021 - Future, probably not doing the same thing I am doing today.
