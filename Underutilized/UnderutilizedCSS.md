# Underutilized CSS Features

Haven't we been on CSS3 for a while now? When is CSS4 coming? CSS hasn't gotten any major updates in a while.

Yes, CSS3 has been around for a while. I would bet there are a lot of things still to discover from the [spec](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/specs.en.html). CSS3 brought us a lot of goodness that you might be surprised to find out has been there for a while. 

No, we are not getting a CSS4. [Rachel Andrew](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2016/09/13/why-there-is-no-css4-explaining-css-levels/) goes into detail about the history of the CSS numbering system, and provides an explanation as to why we will not see a v4 of CSS. TL;DR, Numbering things is hard. Moving forward individual features are getting versioned to help promote browser adoption. For example, selectors level 4 is being finalized and starting to ship.

Things are constantly being added to CSS. Two of my most anticipated features have recently dropped, Grid and Variable Fonts!

In this talk I would like to discuss some features, both old and new, that do not get utilized enough. ( In my opinion and experience. )

The items I am going to cover are:

- `border-box: box-sizing;`
- specificity
- calc()
- Flexbox
- CSS Grids
- Custom Properties
- `:focus-within`
- `:not()`
- `:empty`
- position sticky

> These are opinions based on what I have seen doing code reviews, being involved in open source projects, and some things I should be utilizing more.

## Box Sizing

The Box Model is a combination of width, height, padding, margin, and border. The real issue being the padding. If I create a box that is 100 by 100 with a padding of 10, what is my overall box size? 120 x 120. No est√° bueno.

```CSS
*, *:after, *:before {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

## Specificity

In a nutshell, specificity is how the browsers determine the importance, relevance, and "seniority" of a CSS style. Understanding this is key to a clean code base. 

In order from weakest to strongest the browser breaks down the rules like so;
1. Type Selectors and Pseudo-Elements
   1. `div` | `h1` | `a`
   2. `::before` | `::after`
2. Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes
   1. `.card` | `.nav` | `.profile_img`
   2. `[type="text"]` | `[href*="https"]`
   3. `:hover` | `:focus`
3. ID selectors
   1. `#footer` | `#main-content`
4. Inline styles
   1. `<p style="color: red">text</p>`
5. !important
   1. Pronounced "Band Important"

## Calc

Calc is at its core a function that allows developers to perform math functions on different units of measurement. I see this utilized all the time for width and heights. For example, there is a fixed header that is `75px` tall and the body content needs to fill the rest of the screen.

```CSS
.fixed-header { 
  height: 75px;
}

.main-body {
  height: calc(100vh - 75px);
}
```

This is great! But `calc` can be used for a lot more than that. One of the ways I like to use calc is for fluid type. Check out my [CodePen - Fluid Type](https://codepen.io/jermbo/pen/bRKJJd) for an example.

```CSS
html {
  font-size: 12px;
}
@media (min-width: 480px) {
  html {
    font-size: calc(12px + 20 * (100vw - 480px) / 1068);
  }
}
@media (min-width: 1548px) {
  html {
    font-size: 32px;
  }
}
```

## Flexbox

This is starting to be used more and more, but I would like to see this instead of a framework. I think most people, if not every one, are aware of this but have a hard time implementing it into their projects. If you checkout the Can I Use website, you will notice this is green across the board, with minor issues with IE. So, there is no reason not to use this.

## CSS Grids

We have been trying since the beginning of the web to get print style layouts on the web. Before CSS Grid we had to rely on float trickery, Flexbox magic, and other pure hacks to get something close to print. Now the line between web and print have never been more blurry.

CSS Grid is a true layout system on the web. It offers us a 2-dimensional control as well as powerful spacing abilities. You work with a Grid Layout by applying rules to both the parent ( which become Grid Container ) and the child ( which become Grid Items).

One thing to point out is, it's not Grid vs. Flexbox. It's Grid and Flexbox. These are complementary technologies, not competing ones.

## Custom Properties

## Focus Within

Simply put, `:focus-within` is a CSS pseudo-class that represents itself if matched by the `:focus` pseudo-class or has a descendant that is matched by a `:focus`.

A lot of articles have mentioned this in relation to a form and its inputs. When the input of a form is in focus the form is in focus and you can style against that to make it obvious to the user.

I watched a video a while back that gave another example. [Even More CSS Secrets by Lea Verou](https://youtu.be/vs34f9FiHps?t=1449) A keyboard accessible fly out menu. I have recreated her example in my [Nav Focus Within](https://codepen.io/jermbo/pen/aboEBBG) CodePen, to demonstrate her point.

## Empty

The `:empty` element is a pseudo-class which represents any element that has no children. Children can be any element nodes or text, including white space. Any comments, processing instructions, and CSS content do not affect whether an element is empty.

I find this particularly useful when dealing with a CMS or some sort of auto-generated code. WordPress, for example, loves to inject empty paragraphs into the document. If you are in a situation where you cannot control the output this can be quite hard to deal with. 

Let's say, you have a global rule that states all paragraphs have `padding-top: 0.5rem;`. With these empty paragraphs, it looks like you have extra space in places you shouldn't. One way to approach this is to turn off that global rule, and then turn it on for all the items individually. But that doesn't quite work due to the maintenance and consistency nightmare.

With this simple rule you will be able to take care of all the auto-generated woes. Check out my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/jermbo/pen/8b58be73d1c96d9abef2953f8c084964) for a working example.

## Position Sticky

Trying to get anything to scroll with the page, then stop once that element has gotten to the top and stay there has been a nightmare of JavaScript and some crazy CSS trickery. Those days are no more, `position: sticky;` to the rescue. 

In my [CodePen Example](https://codepen.io/jermbo/pen/JgpxZR), I made a simple list inside a scroll container. Each section of the list has a header, and as I scroll I want to see what section the current items are under. Traditionally, that would not be possible without the forementioned trickery. Now, all we need is a `position: sticky;` on the section headers.

```HTML
<div class="container">
  <h2>Sticky Column Headers</>
  <div class="content">
    <div class="category">
      <p class="category__title">Title 1</p>
      <p class="category__item">Item 1</p>
      <p class="category__item">Item 2</p>
      ...
    </div>
    <div class="category">
      ...
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```CSS
.content {
  background: white;
  overflow-y: auto;
  height: 100%;
  box-shadow: 1px 1px 13px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
}

.category__title {
  position: -webkit-sticky;
  position: sticky;
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75);
  top: 0;
  padding: 1.1rem;
  margin: 0;
  font-weight: bold;
  box-shadow: 1px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
}
```

**Browser Support**
[CanIUse](https://caniuse.com/#search=sticky) It's got decent support. There are a couple of gotchas with `thead` and `tr`. And needs vendor prefixes most of the time.
