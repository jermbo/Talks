# Underutilized CSS Features

Haven't we been on CSS3 for a while now? When is CSS4 coming? CSS hasn't gotten any major updates in a while.

Yes, CSS3 has been around for a while. I bet there are a lot of things still to discover from that spec.

No, we are not getting a CSS4. [Rachel Andrew](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2016/09/13/why-there-is-no-css4-explaining-css-levels/) goes into detail about the history of the CSS numbering system, and provides an explanation as to why we will not see a v4 of CSS. TL;DR, Numbering things is hard. Moving forward individual features are getting versioned to help promote browser adoption. For example, selectors level 4 is being finalized and starting to ship.

Things are constantly being added to CSS. Two of my most anticipated features have recently dropped, Grid and Variable Fonts!

In this talk I would like to discuss so features, both old and new, that do not get utilized enough. ( In my opinion and experience. )
