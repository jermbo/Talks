## Industry moves at a rapid pace

Technology is always getting better, smaller, faster, and cheaper. This is not going to change in the near future. 

### Personal Tech History

2000 - 2006(ish) I was designing print materials, using PhotoShop, Illustrator, Quark. Brochures, business cards, logos, product packages, etc.

2003 - 2008(ish) I was building static sites in tables. ( Think of Google Sheets, build a site in that!)

2007 - 2011(ish), I was building sites, games, interactive ads using Flash and ActionScript 3.

2010 - 2017, I was building some sites with regular ol HTML and CSS. Other sites with WordPress and jQuery.

2012, I started getting more involved with build pipelines. Started learning Gulp to get my Sass to compile.

2013, I started taking JavaScript seriously and learned Node. ( Version 0.8.something! )

2014, I built a more elegant build pipeline. Had Sass auto compile, image compressions, ES6 to ES5 transformations, HTML Preprocessor compilations, automatic browser refresh ( now known as Hot Module Reloading ), and asset migration / minification. 

2014, I started taking programming seriously. I went back to the basics. 

2015, I started Palm Beach JavaScript and Teaching at Palm Beach Code School

2017 - Present, I am building sites using Vue, Angular, React, and or Svelte.

2018, Started Code Palm Beach with other like minded parents.

2020 - I am building sites using Vue or React to statically generate a site. ( Basically vanilla HTML and CSS I was building in 2004, but without the tables)

2020 RIP Flash Player 

2021 - Future, probably not doing the same thing I am doing today.

### Then versus now

When I first stated my career, I hated web. Wanted nothing to do with it. The tooling sucked. Not a lot of good information out there. Having to deal with browser incapabilities made things 100 times worse. 

Now, I cannot get enough of it. Tooling has come along way. ( Still room for improvement, but improvements being made all the time. ) More information than we know what to do with. ( Both a good and bad thing. ) Web standards have made things more consistent across platforms. ( We can now focus on features of the site instead of making sure it looks the same across the platforms. )

## How does one keep up

It's a safe bet to state, the stuff you are doing today will be different from what you are doing in 5 years. How does one keep up?

### Read, Watch, Listen

I subscribe to several monthly industry news letters, dozens of YouTube content creators, fellow techies on Twitter. Hear what they are talking about. See if what they are saying applies to what I'm interested in or my day job. Do a bunch of small things to test concepts. Adopt what's interesting or necessary into my process.

*Note:* Just because someone is talking about it does not mean it needs your full attention right away. Let it simmer for a little bit. If more and more people start talking about something, look into it. If it adds something to your day to day, learn it.

### Boot Camps

If you are not sure where to start, Boot Camps are a great kick in the pants. It's a crash corse to get you started on the right path.

*Note:* Boot Camps are the start of your journey. They are the dock master who unties your boat from the pier and nudges your boat into the open ocean. There is a lot more for you to do.

### Tutorials

Keeping up with industry trends and standards is not unique to our industry. Doctors, nurses, teachers, accountants, massage therapists, psychiatrists, mechanics, all have to have continual education credits per year in order to keep their certification or license or insurance. 

The web industry has no set mandate, but do have to keep up. Tutorials are a great way to get a lot of information in a short amount of time. You can find one on any topic you are interested in. With as much depth as you are interested in. If you want just the basics, there is a YouTube video or blog article on it. If you need more in depth understanding, there are whole courses on various platforms on that topic.

### Beware of Tutorial Hell

It's typically recommended to follow along with the tutorial and build the thing at the same time. Nothing better than seeing and doing. 

The problem comes in when you watch a tutorial, and don't see how to apply it to your projects. Or you watch tutorial after tutorial after tutorial and don't know how to get out of that.

This is called Tutorial Hell. It's a downward spiral that will happen multiple times in your career. Especially when you are picking up something completely new. It's OK. Recognize when it's happening and start working your way out of it.

### Personal Projects

The best way I get out of Tutorial Hell is by having personal projects. These projects do not need to be huge, grandiose, all encompassing projects that is going to take over the world. Rather, smaller projects with a narrow focus that can be iterated on, rebuilt, redesigned, on a regular basis. It could be something that already exists. It just needs to be in your repository.

### Playgrounds

When working on client projects, you need to get the job done. It is hard to argue to use a new technology. Especially if it's new to you and your team. Offers no tangible improvement to your process or the end result. It offers an immature ecosystem, things like; plugins, pre-built solutions, examples, reference docs, tutorial articles and or videos. Or you are unaware of the "gotchas" due to lack of experience. 

These personal projects are great playgrounds for you to test these aspects. Your playground is a safe place to learn the "gotchas", figure out how mature the ecosystem is, and learn how to possibly train your team on this tech. 

## Does this directly lead to success

Some say, success is being in the right place at the right time. While I agree that luck is involved, I would like to add that being prepared is very crucial. If the right opportunity comes up and your are not prepared for it, that opportunity will pass you by.

I firmly believe the opportunities have presented themselves to me because of my preparation.

### Success is what you make it

Personally, I believe success is what you make it. If you always compare yourself to the top players and wonder "what if", you will not be a success. 

If you take a step back, look at where you came from, where you currently are, and where you want to go, then you will be a success. 

It's not bad to have goals and aim for the stars. But if all you focus on is "I have not reached the stars", then things will be disappointing.

Take a moment, celebrate the small wins, acknowledge the growth, learn from your mistakes, grow yourself, and success will follow. 

### Impostor Syndrome

"Impostor Syndrome is a psychological pattern in which an individual doubts their skills, talents or accomplishments and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a "fraud". Despite external evidence of their competence, those experiencing this phenomenon remain convinced that they are frauds, and do not deserve all they have achieved." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)

I believe a small dose of this is healthy. This means you are aware of what you don't know and strive to know more. Striving to be better is a good thing.

This is a very slippery slope. One can quickly slip into down and never try anything new or challenge themselves. 

I bring this up to so you can be aware of what's this is called, not to scare you. You will feel this way multiple times in your career. It's ok. Things will click and understanding will happen.

## History of SampleAPIs

While I was teaching at a boot camp, we had 2 days set aside for learning RESTful APIs. How to CRUD. What HTTP Verbs Meant. The first time I taught this class, I thought it would be cool to let the students pick any API they wanted. ( From a curated list, of course. ) And even with that we spent an entire day, just getting authenticated. 

Authentication is an important part of the process, but does not matter when learning the basics.

### How it solved a problem

Sample APIs started off as FuturamaDB. This had multiple endpoints for characters, actors, quiz questions, and general info. From here, I was able to teach the students how to build a Futurama Quiz. There was no need for authentication so we could purely focus on the API and quiz functionality.

### How it's evolved

Once I got Futurama down, I started thinking about other popular shows or books that I could build to help offer variety. So I created, SimpsonsDB, Game Of Thrones DB, Harry Potter DB, and Bobs Burger DB.

After taking a step back, I questioned the expense of having a domain for each random database I wanted to create. Instead, I figured it would make more sense to have one spot for any number of databases one could utilize. 

Sample APIs was born.

### Where it's currently at

We are currently on version 3.0 of the application. The front end is built in React and TypeScript. The back end is built with Node, Express, JSON-Server, and various utility tools. This lives in a mono-repo in my [GitHub](https://github.com/jermbo/SampleAPIs).

Version 2.0 of the application was a server rendered application using the Pug engine for Node. There was a bit of Vue to power the home page. I decided to decouple the front from the back and build in React. This allowed me to simplify the configuration needed to power the front end vs the back end. As well as opening up the possibilities for features I've been wanting to add.

### Where it's going

The rest of version 3 is about documentation and examples. The heart of this tool is learning, playing, and having fun. We need to expand on explanations. Provide fun examples to help inspire usage.

Future versions of this will include playgrounds for anyone to quickly start a temporary API. User profiles and the ability to have more permanent playgrounds.

Also, open for ideas!

### How can you contribute

There are a couple of ways to contribute. 

First, create a data set that you find interesting. The more data sets the merrier.

Create example applications using the data from the endpoints. My goal is to have a CodePen for every endpoint on the system.

Add or modify documentation. Collaborating on a better way to explain something is how this tool succeeds.
