# Scratch Your Own Itch

Why personal projects are useful tools for your success. Let’s learn how Sample APIs solved a problem I had. How it’s evolved over the years. And why I’m passionate about it. We will take a look under the hood and see how the system is built, what technologies are used, and learn how to contribute to open source.

## Industry moves at a rapid pace

Technology is always getting better, smaller, faster, and cheaper. This is not going to change in the near future. 

### Personal Tech History

2000 - 2006(ish) I was designing print materials, using PhotoShop, Illustrator, Quark. Brochures, business cards, logos, product packages, etc.

2003 - 2008(ish) I was building static sites in tables. ( Think of Google Sheets, build a site in that!)

2007 - 2011(ish), I was building sites, games, interactive ads using Flash and ActionScript 3.

2010 - 2017, I was building some sites with regular ol HTML and CSS. Other sites with WordPress and jQuery.

2012, I started getting more involved with build pipelines. Started learning Gulp to get my Sass to compile.

2013, I started taking JavaScript seriously and learned Node. ( Version 0.8.something! )

2014, I built a more elegant build pipeline. Had Sass auto compile, image compressions, ES6 to ES5 transformations, HTML Preprocessor compilations, automatic browser refresh ( now known as Hot Module Reloading ), and asset migration / minification. 

2015, I started taking programming seriously. I went back to the basics. 

2017 - Present, I am building sites using Vue, Angular, React, and or Svelte.

2020 - I am building sites using Vue or React to statically generate a site. ( Basically vanilla HTML and CSS I was building in 2004, but without the tables)

2020 RIP Flash Player 

2021 - Future, probably not doing the same thing I am doing today.

### Then versus now

When I first stated my career, I hated web. Wanted nothing to do with it. The tooling sucked. Not a lot of good information out there. Having to deal with browser incapabilities made things 100 times worse. 

Now, I cannot get enough of it. Tooling has come along way. ( Still room for improvement, but improvements being made all the time. ) More information than we know what to do with. ( Both a good and bad thing. ) Web standards have made things more consistent across platforms. ( We can now focus on features of the site instead of making sure it looks the same across the platforms. )

## How does one keep up

### Boot Camps

If you are not sure where to start, Boot Camps are a great kick in the pants. It's a crash corse to get you started on the right path. Boot Camps are the start of your journey. They are the dock master who unties your boat from the pier and nudges your boat into the open ocean. There is a lot more for you to do.

### Tutorials

Keeping up with industry trends and standards is not unique to our industry. Doctors, nurses, massage therapists, psychiatrists, mechanics, all have to have continual education credits per year in order to keep their certification or license or insurance. 

The web industry has no set mandate, but do have to keep up. Tutorials are a great way to get a lot of information in a short amount of time. You can find one on any topic you are interested in. With as much depth as you are interested in. If you want just the basics, there is a YouTube video or blog article on it. If you need more in depth understanding, there are whole courses on various platforms on that topic.

### Beware of Tutorial Hell

It's typically recommended to follow along with the tutorial and build the thing at the same time. Nothing better than seeing then doing. 

The problem comes in when you watch a tutorial, and don't see how to apply it to your projects. Or you watch tutorial after tutorial after tutorial and don't know how to get out of that.

This is called Tutorial Hell. It's a downward spiral that will happen multiple times in your career. Especially when you are picking up something completely new. It's OK. Recognize when it's happening and start working your way out of it.

### Personal Projects

The best way I get out of Tutorial Hell is by having personal projects. These projects do not need to be huge, grandiose, all encompassing project that is going to take over the world. Rather, smaller projects with a narrow focus that can be iterated on, rebuilt, redesigned, on a regular basis. It could be something that already exists. It just needs to be in your repository.

#### Some Ideas

* Personal Blog
* Personal Inventor System
* HoneyDo List
* Personal Budget Tracker
* Movie / Book / Game Suggestion List
* Workout Tracker

### Playgrounds

When working on client projects, you need to get the job done. It is hard to argue to use a new technology. Especially if it's new to you and your team. Offers no tangible improvement to your process or the end result. It offers an immature ecosystem, things like; plugins, pre-built solutions, examples, reference docs, tutorial articles and or videos. Or you are unaware of the "gotchas" due to lack of experience. 

These personal projects are great playgrounds for you to test these aspects. Your playground is a safe place to learn the "gotchas", figure out how mature the ecosystem is, and learn how to possibly train your team on this tech.
